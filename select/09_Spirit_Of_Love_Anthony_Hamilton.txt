Today is the day
We celebrate His love
The work of the savior
That was send to us.
The lion Judah
We saved by birth

Every knell will bow for you
And every heart will be for you
And everyone will sing to you

Come let him free your hearts

For the righteous one

The hope to sing in His kingdom
From the king of Kings
