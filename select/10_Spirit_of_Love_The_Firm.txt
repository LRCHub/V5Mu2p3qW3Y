Look to your heart.
Don't wait an hour.
The way is there somehow
No matter how long
No matter how long
Don't give in...

When you're down on your knees, the whole world is counting
And you know it would please your enemies to count you out.
Reach down inside and find somehow
When you ask, is there someone out there who loves.
Somewhere out there who can.
Don't lose hope...

If you have the spirit of love to carry the day,
The spirit of your love will show you the way.
