Thou art gone from my gaze like a beautiful dream
And I seek there in vain by the meadow and stream
Oft I breathe out your name to the winds floating by
But the sweet voice is mute to my cry

In the stillness of night when the stars mightily shine
My heart fondly holds a communion with thine
For I feel thou art near and where e'er I may be
That the spirit of love watches me

Oft the birds in the bower now companion I make
Every simple wildflower I prize for the sake
Deep woods and dark clouds can now pleasure impart
For the solitude suits my poor heart

Thou art gone from my gaze, yet I will not repine
E'er long we shall meet in a home that is thine
For I feel thou art near and where e'er I may be
That the spirit of love watches me
