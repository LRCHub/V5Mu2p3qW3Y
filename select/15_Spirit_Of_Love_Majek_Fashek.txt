Heaven and Earth would pass away
Night and day will pass away
Moon and stars will pass away
The spirit of love shall never go away
The spirit of love shall always be the same
Silver and gold will pass away
Oil and coal will pass away

What is bought and sold will pass away
But the spirit of love will never go away
The spirit of love shall always be the same
Mama mama mama mama mama yo
Mama mama mama mama mama yo
Lord I tried to make it, I can't make it
'Cause I tried to do it, I can't do it
But I know my faith will lead me through
But I know my faith shall see me through

Some a say I am a lazy boy
Them a say I am a crazy boy
Some said I am a hazel boy
The spirit of love shall never go away
The spirit of love shall always be the same
The spirit of love will never lead me astray
The spirit of love shall always be the same
